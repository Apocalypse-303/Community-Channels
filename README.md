Thank you for using **Community Channels**! This program allows you to **create private & optional channels**, without the need to give any users permissions. They will have full control of their channel, but **only their channel**.

**How to get started:**

1. [Invite The Bot/Program](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=386059740805070848&permissions=536964176&scope=bot)
2. Type `~create` in chat, to make your first private channel
3. Invite a user doing `~invite username`
4. Assign the channel to a user doing `~assign @user`
5. You're done! Now you can use `~help` to view the commands

**How to setup Channel Lists **_**\(image below\)**_

1. Create a new channel, usually named `optional-channels`
2. Type `~channelList` in your new channel
3. Type `~autoDelete #channel-you-just-made`
4. You're done! Now you can use `~setpublic true` & `~setpublic true official`
